Async/Await

Resources:
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38180080/when-to-use-promise-all

Returns:
* Async functions always return a promise. If the return value of an 
async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly 
wrapped in a promise.

Synchronous vs. asynchronous:
* A function using async and await will run asynchronously compared to 
the point it was originally called.
* However, if the function has async and no await, then it will run 
synchronously compared to the point it was originally called. 
* Inside a function block with async and await the code runs 
synchronously

Examples:
* async-await-1.html : Here we see the correct use of async and await. The 
main code runs synchronously and make a call to a function that has async/await.
The main code continue executing and the function runs asynchronously. Inside
the function the code runs synchronously.
