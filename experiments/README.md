This part of the repository is dedicated to learning experiences from workshops and tutorials and experiments I have done with pieces of code and small projects.

# JavaScript

## Async/Await

# npm

- npm stands for node package manager, which is a package manager for JavaScript.
- It is often used in JavaScript projects to get easy access of packages and to manage dependencies in a project.
- The workshop 'How-to-NPM' is an excellent starting point to get your hands dirty on npm and see its options and functionality, and, as its creator says, this workshop is "A module to teach you how to module.".
